We are pleased to announce the release of Zephyr RTOS version 2.2.0.

Major enhancements with this release include:

* We added initial support for 64-bit ARMv8-A architecture (Experimental).

No security vulnerabilities received.

API Changes
***********

Deprecated in this release
==========================

* Settings

  * SETTINGS_USE_BASE64, encoding values in base64 is marked for removal.

Stable API changes in this release
==================================

* GPIO

  * GPIO API has been reworked to support flags known from Linux DTS GPIO
    bindings. They will typically be defined in the board DTS file

    - GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW, GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH used to set pin active level
    - GPIO_OPEN_DRAIN, GPIO_OPEN_SOURCE used to configure pin as open drain or
      open source
    - GPIO_PULL_UP, GPIO_PULL_DOWN used to configure pin bias

  * Reading / writing of pin logical level is supported by gpio_pin_get,
    gpio_pin_set functions.
  * Reading / writing of pin physical level is supported by gpio_pin_get_raw,
    gpio_pin_set_raw functions.
  * New set of port functions that operate simultaneously on multiple pins
    that belong to the same controller.
  * Interrupts should be configured by a dedicated
    gpio_pin_interrupt_configure() function. Configuring interrupts via
    gpio_pin_configure() is still supported but this feature will be removed
    in future releases.
  * New set of flags allows to set arbitrary interrupt configuration (if
    supported by the driver) based on pin physical or logical levels.
  * New set of flags to configure pin as input, output or in/out as well as set
    output initial state.
  * Majority of the old GPIO API has been deprecated. While the care was taken
    to preserve backward compatibility due to the scope of the work it was not
    possible to fully achieve this goal. We recommend to switch to the new GPIO
    API as soon as possible.
  * Areas where the deprecated API may behave differently to the original old
    implementation are:

    - Configuration of pin interrupts, especially involving GPIO_INT_ACTIVE_LOW
      and GPIO_POL_INV flags.
    - Behavior of gpio_pin_configure() when invoked without interrupt related
      flags. In the new implementation of this deprecated functionality the
      interrupts remain unmodified. In the original implementation some of the
      GPIO drivers would disable the interrupts.

  * Several drivers that rely on the functionality provided by the GPIO API
    were reworked to honor pin active level. Any external users of these
    drivers will have to update their DTS board files.

    - bluetooth/hci/spi.c
    - display/display_ili9340.c
    - display/ssd1306.c
    - ieee802154/ieee802154_mcr20a.c
    - ieee802154/ieee802154_rf2xx.c
    - lora/sx1276.c
    - wifi/eswifi/eswifi_core.c
    - majority of the sensor drivers

* PWM

  * The pwm_pin_set_cycles(), pwm_pin_set_usec(), and
    pwm_pin_set_nsec() functions now take a flags parameter. The newly
    introduced flags are PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL and PWM_POLARITY_INVERTED
    for specifying the polarity of the PWM signal. The flags parameter
    can be set to 0 if no flags are required (the default is
    PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL).
  * Similarly, the pwm_pin_set_t PWM driver API function function now
    takes a flags parameter. The PWM controller driver must check the
    value of the flags parameter and return -ENOTSUP if any
    unsupported flag is set.

* USB

  * The usb_enable() function, which was previously invoked automatically
    by the USB stack, now needs to be explicitly called by the application
    in order to enable the USB subsystem.
  * The usb_enable() function now takes a parameter, usb_dc_status_callback
    which can be set by the application to a callback to receive status events
    from the USB stack. The parameter can also be set to NULL if no callback is required.

* nRF flash driver

  * The nRF Flash driver has changed its default write block size to 32-bit
    aligned. Previous emulation of 8-bit write block size can be selected using
    the CONFIG_SOC_FLASH_NRF_EMULATE_ONE_BYTE_WRITE_ACCESS Kconfig option.
    Usage of 8-bit write block size emulation is only recommended for
    compatibility with older storage contents.

* Clock control

  * The callback prototype (clock_control_cb_t) has now additional argument
    (clock_control_subsys_t) indicating which clock subsystem got started.

Removed APIs in this release
============================

* Shell

  * SHELL_CREATE_STATIC_SUBCMD_SET (deprecated), replaced by
    SHELL_STATIC_SUBCMD_SET_CREATE
  * SHELL_CREATE_DYNAMIC_CMD (deprecated), replaced by SHELL_DYNAMIC_CMD_CREATE

* Newtron Flash File System (NFFS) was removed. NFFS was removed since it has
    serious issues, not fixed since a long time. Where it was possible
    NFFS usage was replaced by LittleFS usage as the better substitute.
